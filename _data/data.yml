    The skills section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can list out the various skills that you possess that are relevant to the job you are applying for. This section allows you to highlight your strengths and demonstrate your capabilities to potential employers.

    The skills section can include both hard skills and soft skills. Hard skills are specific technical abilities or knowledge related to a particular job or industry, such as proficiency in programming languages or experience with certain software programs. Soft skills are more general personal traits and abilities, such as communication skills, leadership, problem-solving, or teamwork.

    When crafting your skills section, it's important to tailor it to the specific job you are applying for, and only include skills that are relevant to the position. This can help catch the attention of the hiring manager and demonstrate that you have the qualifications necessary to succeed in the role.

    There are multiple ways to present your skills here. One way is to show them in a rating format. Another way is to group them together. Alternatively, you can use markdown to format it in a way that you prefer.

    The organization section in a resume, specifically for social contexts, is a section where you can showcase any relevant involvement or leadership positions in social, cultural, or community organizations. This section can highlight your commitment to social causes and your ability to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.

    In this section, you can list the name of the organization, your role and responsibilities, the duration of your involvement, and any significant achievements or accomplishments. You can also mention any skills or qualities you gained from your involvement, such as leadership, teamwork, communication, or problem-solving skills.

    This section can be especially valuable for candidates seeking positions in the non-profit sector, social work, or community engagement roles, where experience in social or cultural organizations can demonstrate a genuine passion for social causes and a willingness to work collaboratively towards social change. However, it is important to only include organizations that are relevant to the job you are applying for, and avoid listing organizations that may be controversial or potentially offensive.

  title: Self-evaluation
  description: |
    The self-evaluation section in a resume is a section where you can evaluate and assess your own skills, strengths, and weaknesses. It is typically a short paragraph or bullet points at the end of your resume, which provides a personal perspective on your abilities and how they align with the requirements of the job.

    In this section, you can highlight your achievements, areas of expertise, and any unique qualities or experiences that set you apart from other candidates. You can also mention areas where you are looking to improve or gain further experience.

    A well-crafted self-evaluation section can demonstrate your self-awareness and confidence in your abilities, as well as your willingness to continuously learn and grow. However, it is important to be honest and avoid over-inflating your skills or qualifications, as this can negatively impact your credibility and the hiring manager's impression of you.

reference:
  show: false
  order: 
  title: References
  description: |
    A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

    It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

    When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

    It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
